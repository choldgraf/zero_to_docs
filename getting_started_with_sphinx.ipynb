As we all know, developing is a lot more fun than maintaining a website, and luckily some people threw together a collection of tools that automatically generate documentation for you.\n",

    "One such tool is Sphinx, a package that will scan your codebase for structured text, and use this to convert it into beautifully-rendered webpages. Sphinx also has an ecosystem of plugins that will let you extend its functionality. This is a quick introduction to sphinx, and will cover setting up a simple sphinx section of your project.\n",
